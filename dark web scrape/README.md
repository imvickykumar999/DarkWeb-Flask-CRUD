It looks like your `torrc` configuration file is set up to handle some Tor-related tasks, but it does not include the necessary SOCKS and Control ports configuration. You need to ensure that the Tor service is configured to listen on the correct ports. 

Here are the steps to modify your `torrc` file:

1. **Add SOCKS and Control Ports:**
   Open your `torrc` file and add the following lines to ensure that Tor is listening on the necessary ports:

   ```
   SOCKSPort 9050
   ControlPort 9051
   ```

2. **Save the Configuration:**
   Save the changes to your `torrc` file and restart the Tor service to apply the new configuration.

3. **Verify the Tor Configuration:**
   Make sure your `torrc` file looks something like this:

   ```plaintext
   # This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved
   # The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1, and Tor will ignore it

   ClientOnionAuthDir C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/onion-auth
   DataDirectory C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor
   GeoIPFile C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip
   GeoIPv6File C:/Users/surface/Desktop/Tor Browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip6
   HiddenServiceDir C:/Users/surface/Documents/GitHub/DarkWeb-Flask-CRUD/HiddenServiceDir
   HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9151

   SOCKSPort 9050
   ControlPort 9051
   ```

4. **Restart Tor:**
   After modifying and saving the `torrc` file, restart the Tor Browser or the Tor service to apply the new configuration.

5. **Check Tor Logs:**
   If the issue persists, check the Tor logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what is going wrong. This can help you identify and fix any configuration issues.

Once you have ensured that Tor is correctly configured and running, you can test your Python script again:

```python
from requests_tor import RequestsTor

# Initialize the RequestsTor object
requests = RequestsTor(tor_ports=(9050,), tor_cport=9051)

url = 'http://ziksbo7eq74itlcfzngr6lrrggotqzsjago5fodrth73ktmvefigb6qd.onion'

# Make a GET request through Tor
r = requests.get(url)

# Print the response text
print(r.text)
```

By following these steps, you should be able to establish a connection to the .onion site using the `requests_tor` library. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know!
